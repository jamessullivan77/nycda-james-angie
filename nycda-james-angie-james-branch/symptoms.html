			<h4>Symptoms</h4>
			<p>Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer often don't occur until the disease is advanced. When signs and symptoms do appear, they may include:

			<li> Upper abdominal pain that may radiate to your back </li>
			<li>Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) </li>
			<li> Loss of appetite </li>
			<li> Weight loss </li>
			<li> Depression </li>
			<li> Blood clots </li>
			<li> When to see a doctor </li>
			</p>

			<p>See your doctor if you experience unexplained weight loss with or without a new diagnosis of diabetes or if you have persistent fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, or other signs and symptoms that bother you. Many diseases and conditions other than cancer may cause similar signs and symptoms, so your doctor may check for these conditions as well as for pancreatic cancer.
