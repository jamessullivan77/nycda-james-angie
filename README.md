This Project is a Workshop: Group Collaboration with Git and GitHub.
We have to choose a cause that we care about and  put together a small informational website using HTML/CSS trying to convince people to donate to or help out this cause. 
This site should be 2-3 pages and look as professional as possible using modern design trends.
We chose Pancratic Cancer and made a informative website as well as a hompage you can donate to.
